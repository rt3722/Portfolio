# Machine Learning Projects Portfolio 

Hello there, welcome to my repository! This is a comprehensive collection of all my Machine Learning projects, which showcases my understanding and application of various Machine Learning concepts and techniques. 

## Overview

This repository consists of a collection of different Machine Learning projects spanning different domains and datasets. The projects are primarily written in Python, and use a variety of machine learning models, libraries, and frameworks such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and more.

## Table of Contents

Project 1: Intel Image Classification using Deep Learning \n
This project is based on the Intel Image Classification dataset, which contains a total of 17k images of natural scenes from around the world, including both natural landscapes and buildings. The dataset has been split into 14k images for training and 3k for testing, with each image sized at 150x150 pixels.

The main challenge tackled in this project was to correctly classify these images into one of six classes: "buildings", "forest", "glacier", "mountain", "sea", and "street". To solve this multi-class classification problem, I utilized deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This allowed for robust and effective learning from the complex, high-dimensional data present in the images.

The outcomes of this project included not only the development of a predictive model with high accuracy, but also an in-depth exploration of various deep learning techniques and their application to real-world image classification tasks.
